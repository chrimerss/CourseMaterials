    "1. Creat a `Model` object by passing it the observed head series. Store your model in a variable so that you can use it later on. \n",
    "2. Add the stresses that are expected to cause the observed head variation to the model. In this example, this is only the recharge series. For each stess, a `StressModel` object needs to be created. Each `StressModel` object needs three input arguments: the time series of the stress, the response function that is used to simulate the effect of the stress, and a name. In addition, it is recommended to specified the `kind` of series, which is used to perform a number of checks on the series and fix problems when needed. This checking and fixing of problems (for example, what to substitute for a missing value) depends on the kind of series. In this case, the time series of the stress is stored in the variable `recharge`, the Gamma function is used to simulate the response, the series will be called `'recharge'`, and the kind is `prec` which stands for precipitation. One of the other keyword arguments of the `StressModel` class is `up`, which means that a positive stress results in an increase (up) of the head. The default value is `True`, which we use in this case as a positive recharge will result in the heads going up. Each `StressModel` object needs to be stored in a variable, after which it can be added to the model. \n",

    "It can be seen in the figure shown above that the residuals are not random: there are long periods where the residuals are positive (the observed head is higher than the modeled head) and long periods where the residual is negative (the observed head is lower than the modeled head). This is called autocorrelation. Simply said: the residual of measurement $i$ depends on the residual of measurement $i-1$. This was actually to be expected. One of the reasons for autocorrelated residuals is that the weather station where the rainfall is measured is a certain distance from the observation well. So it is very well possible that rainfall was recorded at the weather station while it didn't rain near the observation well. This means that the model will simulate an increase of the head over a number of days, while the observed head did not increase, resulting in a sequence of negative residuals. The opposite is possible as well, of course, resulting in a sequence of positive residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with autocorrelated residuals is that all estimates of the uncertainty of the parameters of the model are based on the underlying assumption that the residuals are not correlated, in statistical terms: the residuals are  independent. Residuals may be made independent by using a noise model. The simplest noise model is that the residual at measurement $i$ is equal to a factor times the residual at measurement $i-1$ plus a random and independent error $v_i$. The random independent error $v_i$ is also called noise or innovation in time series lingo (the latter is not a very descriptive term, so we will call it noise here). In hydrological time series, the time between observations is rarely constant. It may be expected that the residual of today is stronger correlated with the residual of yesterday than with the residual of last week or last month. The noise model used here is designed such that residual $i$ is equal to a factor times residual $i-1$ plus a random noise, but the factor decreases exponentially when the time between residual $i$ and residual $i-1$ increases.

The units of $\\alpha$ are time. For example when $\\alpha=10$ days, than the residual of today is $\\exp(-3)=0.05$ times the residual of 30 days ago (plus a random error, of course). \n",

    "The calibration period can be defined with the `tmin` and `tmax` keyword arguments of the `solve` method. The `tmin` and `tmax` can be strings (as in the example below) or `pandas Timestamp` objects. Another keyword argument of the `solve` method is `report`, which can be set to `False` so that no report is printed to the screen. In the example below, we return to the data of the first example. The model is fit on the period from 1995 to 2000 (marked with light blue in the figure). Note that the fit is now much better between 1995 and 2000 as compared to the case when the entire dataset is used (but less good elsewhere)."

    "A time series is called stationary if the characteristics of the series don't change through time (they are stationary through time). To test whether this is the case, fit model `ml2` as defined above on 7 year periods with starting times every year from 1990 to 2005 (so fit 15 models). Create the following three plots:\n",
    "1. For each calibration period, plot the simulated head on the same graph (so 15 models on the same graph). First compute the simulated head with `ml2.simulate()` for each model for the same period and store the results, then plot the 15 models on the same graph (using `ml2.plot()` will create 15 separate figures). If there is a lot of spread, the series may not be stationary. You will find that there is one five-year period (starting in 1999) that does a poor job. Apparently, the 5 year periods starting in 1999 is not very representative of the other 5-year periods. \n",
    "2. Plot the 15 block response functions of the recharge series of 15 models.\n",
    "3. Plot the 15 values of the evaporation factor. Does the evaporation factor change much through time? How does that compare to the confidence interval of the evaporation factor?"
