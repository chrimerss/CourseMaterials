    "Seawater is heavier than the freshwater due to the presence of the salt. \n",
    " The density of freshwater is $\\rho\\approx 1000$ kg/m$^3$ while the density of seawater is $\\rho\\approx 1025$ kg/m$^3$.  Note that the saltwater in coastal aquifers isn't all that salty: the density of a saturated salt solution is on the order of 1200 kg/m$^3$.\n",
    " \n",
    " The density of groundwater is a function of many parameters, including the pressure, temperature and salinity. In coastal aquifers, the effect of the salinity is the dominant one. The relationship between the salinity and the density is called an equation of state and can be approximated for salt groundwater originating from seawater by (e.g., Oude Essink et al. 2010)\n",

    "Freshwater floats on top of saltwater as the freshwater is lighter than the saltwater. The freshwater is seperated from the saltwater by a brackish transition zone in which the water varies from freshwater to saltwater.\n",
    "The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater is often thin, in which case it can be represented by an interface separating the freshwater from the saltwater. The landward intrusion of seawater in coastal aquifers is referred to as seawater intrusion where saltwater forms a wedge below the freshwater (e.g., Werner et al., 2013). The point of the wedge along the base of the aquifer that intrudes farthest inland is referred to as the toe of the interface. The toe moves farther inland when the flux of freshwater towards the coast decreases."
