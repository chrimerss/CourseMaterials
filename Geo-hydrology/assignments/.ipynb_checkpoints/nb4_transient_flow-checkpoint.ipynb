    "In reality, the head is not only a function of space, but also a function of time. When the head increases, more water is stored in the aquifer, and when the head decreases, less water is stored in the aquifer. For steady flow, continuity of flow states that the divergence of the discharge vector  is equal to the areal recharge rate $N$.\n",

    "When groundwater flow is transient, the divergence of the discharge vector is equal to the areal recharge plus the decrease in storage of water in the aquifer. The physics of the storage process is different for unconfined aquifers than for confined aquifers, but with suitable approximations, both lead to the same governing differential equation. The derivation of the governing equation for transient flow from the general statement of conservation of mass includes many approximations which are not discussed here. Rigorous derivations stating all necessary approximations are provided by, e.g., Verruijt (1969) and Brutsaert (2005).\n",

In practice, the storativity is always smaller than the porosity, as there is water present in the pores above the phreatic surface. The storativity of an unconfined aquifer is also called the specific yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider a column of a confined aquifer with constant surface area $A$. When the head is now increased by d$h$, the volume of water still increases by an amount d$V$ according to the equation above, but the storage coefficient is much smaller. Additional water can only be stored in the column through compression of the water and expansion of the aquifer. For most unconsolidated aquifers, the ability of the aquifer to expand is significantly larger than the ability of the water to compress, so that the compression of the water may be neglected. The storage coefficient of a confined aquifer is a function of the aquifer thickness: an aquifer of the same material but twice the thickness has a storage coefficient that is twice as large.

    "This non-linear differential equation for transient unconfined flow is called the Boussinesq equation (Boussinesq, 1904). A common way to linearize the equation is to replace the head $h$ in front of the time-derivative on the right-hand side by an average head $\\overline{h}$ (e.g, Strack, 2017), so that the diffusivity of an unconfined aquifer becomes $D=S/(k\\overline{h})$. Note that after linearization, unconfined flow is also described by the diffusion equation (in absence of areal infiltration). Another way to linearize the differential equation for transient unconfined flow is to use the differential equation for transient confined flow, to approximate the transmissivity by $T\\approx k\\overline{h}$, and to use the storage coefficient for unconfined flow. This latter approach is used in this Notebook.\n",

    "Exact solutions for transient groundwater flow are, not surprisingly, more difficult to obtain than those for steady flow. Common mathematical approaches include separation of variables, Fourier series, and Laplace or other transforms (e.g., Bruggeman, 1999). The solution of combined transient confined and transient unconfined flow is not as easy as for steady flow, because the storage coefficients differ between confined and unconfined flow. In this Notebook, solutions are presented, without derivation, for one-dimensional flow. These solutions are valid for both confined and for unconfined flow as long as the linearization of the differential equation for unconfined flow is reasonable."

    "#### Exercise 5\n",
    "Consider a well in a thin, confined aquifer. The well is located near a long straight river which is in full contact with the aquifer. Drawdown data is measured in the well and given in the table below. The river is roughly straight, and about 35 m from the well. The discharge of the well is 55 m$^3$/day. The diameter of the well is 80 cm.  \n",
