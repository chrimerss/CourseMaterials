    "flow in single aquifer systems with isotropic and homogeneous properties. These flow types and others are\n",

    "#### Spatial Dimension\n",
    "Flow in an aquifer may be one-, two- or three-dimensional\n",
    "depending on the boundary conditions associated with the flow.\n",
    "Most aquifers are relatively thin in comparison to their areal\n",
    "extent. In these settings, which are referred to as shallow\n",
    "aquifers, one- and two-dimensional analyses are often adequate. In\n",
    "shallow aquifers the vertical variations in the hydraulic head are\n",
    " negligibly small when compared to horizontal variations in\n",
    "head. For problems where three-dimensional flow is important, near\n",
    "local features such as partially penetrating or horizontal wells,\n",
    "or near partially penetrating streams, the effects of concentrated\n",
    "vertical flow can be incorporated approximately into\n",
    "two-dimensional models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Dependence\n",
    "Groundwater flow is either steady or transient.\n",
    "In steady flow, there are no changes in flow or head in\n",
    "time. Analyses of steady flow are used to reflect long-term,\n",
    "average conditions in an aquifer, for example the dewatering of an\n",
    "aquifer for a large construction project, or delineation of\n",
    "wellhead protection areas for municipal water supply wells.\n",
    "Transient flow occurs when aquifer boundary conditions change in\n",
    "time, for example, changing aquifer recharge, changing river\n",
    "levels, and varying pumping rates of wells. A specific application of a transient\n",
    "flow analysis is the evaluation of aquifer properties by field tests,\n",
    "such as pumping tests, when it is not practical to run the test\n",
    "until steady conditions are reached.\n",

    "#### Geologic Setting\n",
    "The geologic setting of an aquifer may be used to further define\n",
    "the flow-type as confined, unconfined, combined, or multi-aquifer\n",
    "flow. The subsoil may be divided in more permeable and less\n",
    "permeable layers.  The permeable layers may transmit significant\n",
    "amounts of water.  They are called aquifers and can be used as the\n",
    "source for drinking water or irrigation. The less permeable layers\n",

    "on top by the groundwater table, also called the phreatic surface (see part b of the figure above).\n",
    "The concept of a groundwater table seems simple: when one digs a\n",
    "deep enough hole, it will fill up with water to the level of\n",
    "the groundwater table. Upon closer examination, the concept is\n",
    "less clear, however. When digging down, the soil gets wetter and\n",
    "wetter until the groundwater table is reached. In the section from\n",
    "the surface to the groundwater table, the pores of the soil are\n",
    "filled with both water and air; this section is called the\n",
    "unsaturated zone. The\n",
    "saturated zone starts at the phreatic surface, which is defined as\n",
    "the depth where the pressure in the water is equal to atmospheric.\n",
    "The phreatic surface is curved when there is flow in the aquifer. The surface goes down in the\n",
    "direction of flow, and thus the velocity of a water particle always has a\n",
    "downward component; in most cases this component is relatively\n",
    "small. \n",
    "\n",
    "In unconfined flow, the saturated thickness varies with the\n",
    "elevation of the water table.\n",
    "Flow in a confined aquifer becomes unconfined when the head\n",

He fills the bucket with 40 cm of dry sand. Next, he measures how much water he needs to add to the bucket such that the water level in the bucket is exactly at the top of the sand; this turns out to be 10 liters.\n",

    "Next, the gohydrologist punches a bunch of holes in the bottom of the bucket and fills it again with 40 cm of dry sand. He proceeds to fill the bucket until the water level is exactly at the top of the bucket. He keeps adding water to the bucket so that the water level remains at the top of the bucket while water flows out of the bucket through the holes in the bottom. Once the situation has become stationary, the hydrogeologist measures that one liter of water flows out of the bottom of the bucket in one minute. Heads are measured with respect to the bottom of the bucket.\n",
